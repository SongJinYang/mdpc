List of demos:

A: a small planar vector field; MCGs with different refinement levels
   the vector field is treated as a closed system (with flow sliding
   along the boundary)

B: same as A, but open system with flow through boundary

C, D: same as A, but for two flows defined on a torus

E, F: same as A, but for a flow defined on the Stanford bunny; in this
      case, PL subdivision is used to increase the resolution of the 
      data

G: MCGs for gas engine, diesel engine and cooling jacket

H: Morse decompositions for ocean data

I: stable Morse decompositions and envelopes for gas engine, diesel engine
   and cooling jacket
